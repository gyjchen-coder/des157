                    <h4> Part 1</h4>
                    <p>
                        Jayden’s image is a squirrel in the field. The interesting thing about the squirrel is that it’s smiling mischievously. The squirrel is clearly standing in an open field with grass. The smile on its face and the way the squirrel puts its two little hands together make the image look like a meme waiting to happen. 

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If he's taking more pictures he might take pictures of the squirrel from different angles, place the iPhone at the ground level, or zoom in on the squirrel’s face, hands, eyes, or ears. Perhaps try shallow depth of field. Juxtaposing it with other objects, play with scales, etc. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If he’s using the same images, he can probably add fun speech bubbles and a collage effects to complement the image. 
                    </p>
                    <h4>Part 2</h4>
                    <p>
                        The image I picked is a normal chest X-ray PA view (taken from the back view, which is the default view for chest X-rays).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The image is part of the few X-ray images I got from a public database online, Radiopaedia.org. I’m trying to tie the bigger class projects to my thesis, which is on patient-friendly radiology reports. I realize that for this assignment, we need to use our own images. But for obvious reason it would be difficult to source all the X-rays myself so I have to rely on a public database. But I created the anatomical image in Illustrator myself.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For this particular project, I’ve decided to create an overlay system where the user can learn the basics of reading radiology images.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An X-ray machine sends high-energy electromagnetic waves through the body. Dense materials like bone absorb more X-rays and appear white on the image, while softer tissues let more X-rays pass through and appear darker. Organs like the lungs, which are filled with air, will appear the darkest. From light to dark, the order is metal(the lightest), bone, soft tissue, fat, and air(the darkest). 

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By mousing over the basic chest anatomy image, different X-rays will appear with specific part highlighted to indicate the structure/issue. 

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am interested in creating patient-friendly medical information. This will be a simple interactive tool to teach the basics of how X-rays work to the general public.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I might refine the color scheme so the presentation is more compelling

                        <p>
                        In the <a class='in-text' href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/" > 10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills</a> New York Times article, it introduces award winning photos as an exercise for school kids to learn to see visually. I enjoy the photos, even for a graduate student like me who has some working experience it’s still interesting to see photos that allows many layers of discoveries. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The most interesting thing about the <a class='in-text' href="https://nfinitepaper.com/" > NFinit Website</a> is its atom-thin water barrier paper technology and the sleek particle animation it uses to illustrate the concept. As you scroll through the website from top to bottom, the particle animation changes and reconfigures from chaos into layers of hundreds of particles to illustrate how the thin moisture barrier layer is formed by zillions of atoms. It’s a very sleek and creative way to illustrate the technical concept. I’d love to know how exactly this is coded and done. It’s really fun to scroll the page up and down and see how the animations go forward and backward responding to your scrolling.
                        </p>
                        <p>   
                            After recently learning to code a form page in this class, I also checked out their Contact page, the form is also very nicely designed. The typography of the whole site is very clean and modern, reflecting the newness of the technology. There is enough size difference between the title and paragraph,and the text is very easy to read due to ample line-spacing. The page is also responsive at mobile size, though the dynamic animation is better viewed at desktop size.

                    <h3>Best Practices for Modals/ Overlays / Dialog Windows</h3>
                        <p><time datetime="2026-01-29">Jan 29, 2026</time>
                            This is a very helpful article on modal. Generally, I feel modal should not be used unless it’s necessary. But it’s very useful in particular to get explicit user buy-in on an important decision, such as exiting the site or connecting to a third-party site. The actions tend to be momentary and require an explicit user decision. 
                        </p>
                        <p>This article summarizes some of the best practices of modal, and when modal should be used:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>need user input</li>
                                <li>show additional information in context, ie. showing larger images or videos.</li>
                                <li>show additional info not in context, ie. notificaitons.</li>
                                <li>do not use to show error success, or warning messages. Keep them on the page. (This particular point might be debatible. Especially the warning messages. but I agree if the warning message is referring to the page content it’s better to have the warning  accessible on the page and not popping in/out and disappear.)</li>
                                <li>anatomy of a modal
                                    <ul class="sublist-num">
                                        <li>cancel button</li>
                                        <li>descriptive title</li>
                                        <li>actionable button with descriptive names</li>
                                        <li>modal in mobile generally not a great idea due to screen real estate</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Accessibility</li>
                            </ol>  
                        <p>For my own thesis I’m working on healthcare designs. So I’m particularly interested in the accessibility aspects. The author mentions keyboard and focus, I might research further into this and the ARIA system, Accessible Rich Internet Applications.</p>

                        <h3>Best Practices for Form Design</h3>
                        <p>
                            <time datetime="2026-01-18">Jan 18, 2026</time>
                           This is an extremely helpful article. It methodically explains the best UX/UI practices in form design. I think one of the less-practiced but salient points is chunking long forms into several major steps. Mobile apps tend to do this due to limited screen size, and it makes the process feel less cumbersome and speedy.  </p>
                        <p>
                            Regarding the specific point of distinguishing optional and required fields, I feel that if it's not required, then it should not be in the form. But most businesses would probably like to gather as much information as possible by including the optional fields. 
                        </p> 
                        <p>
                            Lastly, I am a bit less certain than the author that the form width should conform to the info length. I understand that it's easier to distinguish the info type if the form length conforms to the info length. But the ragged lengths make the form look busy and might add to visual noise. Nevertheless, perhaps this issue can be mitigated through careful design by dimming the visual weight of the uneven form fields. This is something I will try in my form design.
                        </p> 
                        <p>
                            I have included a form field from Etsy.com. It has a few items the author mentioned. They chunked the entire check-out process into three major stages: shipping, payment, and review. Each stage has less than ten form fields, which is very manageable. The entire process doesn't seem too overwhelming. I remember Etsy's early days when the check-out process was very long and complicated. I think especially for e-commerce, the fewer the steps, the quicker consumers will conclude the transaction!
                        </p>
