                    <h3>Best Practices for Modals/ Overlays / Dialog Windows</h3>
                        <p><time datetime="2026-01-29">Jan 29, 2026</time>
                            This is a very helpful article on modal. Generally, I feel modal should not be used unless it’s necessary. But it’s very useful in particular to get explicit user buy-in on an important decision, such as exiting the site or connecting to a third-party site. The actions tend to be momentary and require an explicit user decision. 
                        </p>
                        <p>This article summarizes some of the best practices of modal, and when modal should be used:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>need user input</li>
                                <li>show additional information in context, ie. showing larger images or videos.</li>
                                <li>show additional info not in context, ie. notificaitons.</li>
                                <li>do not use to show error success, or warning messages. Keep them on the page. (This particular point might be debatible. Especially the warning messages. but I agree if the warning message is referring to the page content it’s better to have the warning  accessible on the page and not popping in/out and disappear.)</li>

                                    <ul class="sublist-num">
                                        <li>cancel button</li>
                                        <li>descriptive title</li>
                                        <li>actionable button with descriptive names</li>
                                        <li>modal in mobile generally not a great idea due to screen real estate</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Accessibility</li>
                            </ol>  
                        <p>For my own thesis I’m working on healthcare designs. So I’m particularly interested in the accessibility aspects. The author mentions keyboard and focus, I might research further into this and the ARIA system, Accessible Rich Internet Applications.</p>

                        <h3>Best Practices for Form Design</h3>
                        <p>
                            <time datetime="2026-01-18">Jan 18, 2026</time>
                           This is an extremely helpful article. It methodically explains the best UX/UI practices in form design. I think one of the less-practiced but salient points is chunking long forms into several major steps. Mobile apps tend to do this due to limited screen size, and it makes the process feel less cumbersome and speedy.  </p>
                        <p>
                            Regarding the specific point of distinguishing optional and required fields, I feel that if it's not required, then it should not be in the form. But most businesses would probably like to gather as much information as possible by including the optional fields. 
                        </p> 
                        <p>
                            Lastly, I am a bit less certain than the author that the form width should conform to the info length. I understand that it's easier to distinguish the info type if the form length conforms to the info length. But the ragged lengths make the form look busy and might add to visual noise. Nevertheless, perhaps this issue can be mitigated through careful design by dimming the visual weight of the uneven form fields. This is something I will try in my form design.
                        </p> 
                        <p>
                            I have included a form field from Etsy.com. It has a few items the author mentioned. They chunked the entire check-out process into three major stages: shipping, payment, and review. Each stage has less than ten form fields, which is very manageable. The entire process doesn't seem too overwhelming. I remember Etsy's early days when the check-out process was very long and complicated. I think especially for e-commerce, the fewer the steps, the quicker consumers will conclude the transaction!
